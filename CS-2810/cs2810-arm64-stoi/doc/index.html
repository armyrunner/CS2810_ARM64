<p>Write a function called <code>stoi</code> to convert a string containing a base
10 number to an integer value.</p>

<pre><code>stoi(buffer) -&gt; n
</code></pre>

<p><code>stoi</code> is given the address of a buffer in memory containing a text
representation of an integer value. Here is the basic algorithm for
doing this:</p>

<ul>
<li>start with n = 0</li>
<li>read a character from the buffer and call it c</li>
<li>if the value of c is between &#39;0&#39; and &#39;9&#39; (48 and 57):

<ul>
<li>n = n * 10 + (c - &#39;0&#39;)</li>
<li>read the next character from the buffer and repeat</li>
</ul></li>
<li>else return n</li>
</ul>

<p>You may find it helpful to re-write this into more detailed
pseudo-code before you start writing assembly language.</p>

<p>Note that you do not know in advance how many characters make up the
number. As soon as you read something that is not a digit, you
should assume you have reached the end of the input.</p>

<p>In addition to the outline given above, you should accept an
optional <code>-</code> (minus sign) at the beginning of the input, and return
a negative number instead of a positive number.</p>

<p>For example, if <code>stoi</code> is called with 0x1230 as the value of the
buffer pointer, and memory contains the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>0x1230: &#39;3&#39; (ASCII code 51)</li>
<li>0x1231: &#39;8&#39; (ASCII code 56)</li>
<li>0x1232: &#39;0&#39; (ASCII code 48)</li>
<li>0x1233: &#39;1&#39; (ASCII code 49)</li>
<li>0x1234: &#39;2&#39; (ASCII code 50)</li>
<li>0x1235: &#39; &#39; (ASCII code 32)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your function should return the number 38012.</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<p>To negate a value, you can just subtract it from zero.</p>
