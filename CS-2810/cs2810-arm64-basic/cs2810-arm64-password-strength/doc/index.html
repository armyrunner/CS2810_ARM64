<html><head></head><body><p>Many web sites and applications have specific requirements for
making strong passwords, such as requiring a letter, a digit, a
symbol, and between 8 and 12 characters. In practice, requirements
like these are usually a lowsy way to get people to use good
passwords, and people who actually understand security tend to avoid
them. They are also annoying to users.</p>

<p>While they are bad for security, they can make for an interesting
programming problem. Your task is to write a function that examines
a password (a string) and gives it a score. The following points
contribute to the overall score:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 point if it contains a lower-case letter</li>
<li>1 point if it contains an upper-case letter</li>
<li>1 point if it contains a digit</li>
<li>1 point if it contains a non-alphanumeric symbol, i.e., anything
besides letters and digits (this can include a space character)</li>
<li>1 point if it is 12 characters or longer</li>
<li>1 additional point if it is 16 characters or longer</li>
</ul>

<p>The function is given a single parameter: the address of the
password in memory. The password will only contain printable ASCII
characters with values between 32 and 126, inclusive. The password
is terminated with a null byte, which is just a byte whose value is
zero.</p>

<p>The function should return the score for the password.</p>

<p>Here is pseudo-code for the function:</p>

<pre><code>function strength(password):
    length = 0
    hasLower = 0
    hasUpper = 0
    hasDigit = 0
    hasSymbol = 0
    repeat {
        ch = password[length] (the byte at address password + length)
        if ch == 0 {
            break
        }
        length += 1
        if ch &gt;= &#39;a&#39; and ch &lt;= &#39;z&#39; {
            hasLower = 1
        } else if ch &gt;= &#39;A&#39; and ch &lt;= &#39;Z&#39; {
            hasUpper = 1
        } else if ch &gt;= &#39;1&#39; and ch &lt;= &#39;9&#39; {
            hasDigit = 1
        } else {
            hasSymbol = 1
        }
    }
    score = hasLower + hasUpper + hasDigit + hasSymbol
    if length &gt;= 12 {
        score += 1
    }
    if length &gt;= 16 {
        score += 1
    }
    return score
}
</code></pre>
